summary: "From Nelson and Outcalt (1987), the 'frost number', a
  dimensionless ratio defined by manipulation of either freezing and
  thawing degree-day sums or frost and thaw penetration depths, can be
  used to define an unambiguous latitudinal zonation of permafrost
  continuity. The index is computed using several variables
  influencing the depth of frost and thaw penetration, and can be
  related mathematically to the existence and continuity of
  permafrost. Although the frost number is a useful device for
  portraying the distribution of contemporary permafrost at
  continental scales, it is not capable of detecting relict permafrost
  and should not be mapped over small areas unless numerous climate
  stations are located in the region of interest."
